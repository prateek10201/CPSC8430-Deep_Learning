Welcome to the repository for Homework 1 of the Deep Learning course (CPSC 8430). This repository contains all the necessary files and notebooks for the first assignment.

## File Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

## Tasks Overview

- **Task 1:**
  - `1.1_Simulate_A_Function.ipynb`: Simulates a function as part of the deep learning assignment.
  - `1.2_Train_On_Actual_Tasks.ipynb`: Trains models on actual tasks.

- **Task 2:**
  - `2.1_Visualize_The_Optimization_Process.ipynb`: Visualizes the optimization process of deep learning models.
  - `2.2_Gradient_Norm_Using_PNorm.ipynb`: Analyzes the gradient norm using different P-norms.
  - `2.3_Gradient_Norm_Zero.ipynb`: Explores the scenario where the gradient norm is zero.

- **Task 3:**
